Saugata Gupta: Hi. Good evening to all those who have joined the call. | would like to begin with brief
overview of the operating environment durin the quarter, aftr which 1 wil tke you through
our performance and ste objectives going forward
Our demand conditions during the quarter remained sable. We continued 0 see the building
blocks for a gradual recovery in consumpiion, supporied by moderating inflation, improved
affordability following the recent GST rate raionalization, which has been transformative,
Higher MSPs, and a heathy crop sowing season We belie hes factors provide a consirtive
backirop fo demand improvement cross both urban and ral markets in the coming quarters
Moving on to our quarterly performance, the India business demonsirted a sequential
improvement in volume growih despit an elevated pricing environment, which stared tapering
off towards th end ofthe quarter. Revenue momentum remained song, aided by calibruted
pricing actions across core portfolios ovr the lst 12 months in response to the rise in input
cost. Our franchise have continued to record strong offakes, wilh more than 95% of the
busines ining or sustaining market share and about 80% gaining or sustaining penetration on
MAT basis. Among channels, whi e-commerce and quick commerce were leading growih
rivers, we sa a clear improvement in tradional trade, marking the outcome of consistent
investments and targeted ations over the lst 2 years. Project SETU has continued 0 seengthen
ourdistibution fundamentals, exccution capabilites, and the oxerage expansion remains firmly
on rack, led by desper presence in upgraded owns and pan-India rural scale-up. We will now
commence our intsties on targeted expansion in ban channels, such as chemist, cosmetic,
and specialty food outlets. These actions are enhancing our dire rch, improving product

assortment and availabilty in rural and wil subsequently accelerate our premiumization and
diversification agenda in general rade in the top towns,
Deling decper ino the Indi business, 1 will now share the performance of our key categories.
Parachute continued o demonsiate inherent brand sirengih despite prevailing consumer prices.
underlying volume growth afer adjusting for mage reduction remained positive, demonsiraing
remarkable price elasticity and deep consumer trust and loyalty. With conection having set in
and copra prices down by around 25% to 30% from pesk eves, he brand willbe passing on the
benefit 0 the consumer in the coming month, a5 and when we believe i i the right ime to do
it. While we expect near-temm performanee to remain stable, casing absolute consumer prices
will support a radual recovery in volume growth ver the course of te next yar.
Value-added ai fs delivered nother strong quarter with aceleaed marketshare gains. Our
Value share on MAT basis stands at an all-time high of nearly 30%, showing considera
progres towards premiumization of the mix and bridging the gap between volume and value
share, alone with our intended lines and long-term aspirations. We remain confident of
susaining double-digit growth trjectory in he near-to-medium tem, supported by sharp
strategic focus on the mid and premium segmens, consistent innovation across channcls,
enhanced direct rach through Project SETU, and sirctural ailwinds from he recent GST rae
ronalzation, which has driven affordability.
Saffoa Edible Of had sot quate in a relatively elevated pricing environment, with revenue
roth moderating as prior pricing actions largely anniversarized in this quarter Like in the
previous quater, we have sacrificed volumes which are blow our threshold margins across
cern packs and channels. Going forward, the brand will continue to sharpen its
premiumization agenda, ed by Saffola Gold and Total variants, and th recently inroduced Cold
Pressed Oils, which s doing quite well. Backed by song cauity and focused consumer
activations, we expect Saffola to hart an improving volume growth trajectory in he coming
quarters,
“The Foods portolio performed broadly in line with the sted expeciarions, as we had talked
about inthe last call, that we will ke pause on our growth as we rectify some of the portfolio
‘which is not delivering high on profiailty. So. Saffla Oats continued fo gain marke share
and consolidate market leadership. As we hd conveyed gale, with he portfolio rapidly celing
p10 ARR of INR 1000 crore, our fous has been on stabilization and sicengihening profitability
towards building  sussinable, proftsble growth engin, We remain vry bullish on value-added
foods and utr opportunity i Idi, and our sat to invest in fewer, bigger, beter plays in

roth tmjectory in ur organic food business ver the next wo quarters.

With tht 1 conclude my remarks, Thank you. And we can now ake some questions

Moderator: “Thank you very much. We will now begin the ueston-and-answer session. Our frst question
comes from the line of Abneesh Roy fom Nvama. Please g0 head.

Abneesh Roy: My first question is o the mew acquisition. So. my questions here ar, if you want 1 ake t 3x
three years, if you could alk about what al are needed apart from the brand support. $0 in
ems of distribution for example, where is the company now? For example, INR 140 crore
ARR. how much is coming from which kindof distibution channel? And where do you se the
deta? Second i from a pricing, obviously, this s gourmet, soit premium. Would you plan to
have some kind ofa offering, which also appess to the smlle box GT? 1 do understand he
anger box GT will have an audience, but the small box GT, i there pricing of positioning
whichis possible? And if you could aso talk shout profbily. | do understand initially
investment wil be needed, and tis une 1 Joo at first-year profitability fora band which
anyway may not be making profit. But from a three-year perspective, what will be the
expectation on the profiabily”

Saugata Gupta: First ofall, | would urge you o look at two interesting brands lobaly, which sated of with
popeom and have diversified and become reasonably blockbuster brands. One scaled Lesser
Evil the US. and the other brand is called Proper, which is a UK-based brand. And 1am sure
we will follow thei trajectories and get inspired fom thse brands, And there is another bie
rend inthe US. here is. brand called Skinny Pop, which is growing, aga, hich is: popeorn
and beter-fo-you brand. Now, that will give you an idea of wht s possible in tems of the
porifoio, Now, i ook a the overall, broad sense of the priolo of 4700BC, PVR Cinemas is
very low: Iti just about double digits. Thre is big nstutional busines and export, but they
arc very, very good because, a5 you know, these institutional business creates very good
sampling opportunites. A the same time it also ensures that there smo marketing cost of doing

recently in some ofthe European routes of ndiGo, which gocs to Amsterdam, Manchester, and
us recently, lst week to Athen. Ii available in Vande Bharat and in on or two hotels, And
har busines, plus weave very god business that just started inthe Middle East. We belie
here i sgnificant opportunity now with Marco's acess the e-commerce and othr channels.
So, thatis around 20% 0.25%. The et sal olin, very ie ret. So, we believe that modern
rade, for example where Marco can give acess, and the top-end fod is the best route to grow.
you look tthe rectory of some of the brands, les ake i, Ve, Epigami, they now have
Significant part of ther busines in rtail, and that busines is mising. in terms of investments,
we re happy o do. and a he same time, you must realize today we aleady have some digital
brands lke True Elements. Thre il be huge opportunities in shard costs and other things
when they come ino the Marico fold. So, therefore, this will all happen, there will be no
incremental investment expand into GT. So. that akes care, and last year it made bout INR
12 crores Tos. This plus True Elements together can now have an accelerated path 0 breaking
even with all he tapping ofthe synergies. Ther sa srong innovation pipeline with tis brand,
and we will unfold
Andi you really look a i, Indians, while hey love heal prosiuct, hey don't compromise on
ast. Perhaps indulgence gourmet is gong to grow. As peoples habis in tems of binge-
watching OTT and her tings lke Friday night n, those things which 1 ave sen, which you
sce in developed markets, this progres, th tilwinds towards adoption of this brand is very
high. And therefore, his was missin ink in our cir foods porto. Ifyou look at t,Safola
plays in massage healt, Troc Elements in clea, premium seds and bresfast and snacking
So. this was gap out ther, and t sa perfect gop. And | believe, we aso believe we love the
founders who have a mindset of build to last rather than build to sell. And we are extremely
confident about scaling this bran up, and ts brand we all ove, The products are ery ice,
and we are very. very opiimisic about growing this brand
Pavan Agrawal: Just 10 80d on the profibiliy, Abnecsh, th brand has ross contribution and CZ. which is
aad of Marico's food business at his point in ime. And tis a premium brand. which has
significant pricing power, So, therefore, of cours, we can also expect that the margins can go
even higher in th future, And there re significant synergies n the back-end cost and GTN,
‘which wil be feveraged i the nea erm snd unlock synergies. So, oval rom a profitability
content, ofcourse, we will be investing at this point in time, but whether the brand has pth to
profitability o reach, les say, double-digit margin over apeiod of time, we are fiely confident
ican rally go thre
Abneesh Roy: Onc ortwo follow-ups ther. So ome is, Saugat, you aways mention Mrico, and you obviously
want 10 take bigeer bets. Now. this is around 1% of your revenue. So, docs i ft tha? Not
everything needs o fit. So, that was one question. Second is, your example of the Lessee Evil
brand, for example, Those need a diffrent mindset, and you did sy the founders, cc. So, |

‘wanted to understand, dos this signal that now you want pay in the gourmet inthe impulse
catogory much more over a fonger tem? Because this s completely new whe space you have
opened up. Till no, Safflor he othe brands have been mastly nthe health space. This apens
up he impulse and the gourmet, Obviously, this is foo small So, 1 wanted fo understand, does
his ope up much Bigger opportunity on your wn or sa. even MAA, inthe longer em?

Saugata Gupta: So, our digital busines, sire philosophy is think bi. start small, scale up fast or drop fis.
And therefore, it sa string of pears srtegy to do something big. We are another, maybe two
years from now, we havea INR 2,500 crore digital busines, whic i bigger tha some of the
multinationals companies who have iayed in Indi for 20-25 years So. itis big. The digital
business and the ire diversification agenda has been big. There ar steps o tht bigness rather
an dong one thing. We obviously hae done big things. aur VAHO tararound is a big hing.
“There are opportunities in organically growing big things. Digital Plix, we took tat INR 150
crore. I should be hing INR. 1,000 crore. Again, we have done his. The question is, | dont
eleven buying something big and paying 6x or that. Tha is something which we dont want
odo. Weare far mare prudent, We wan he Founders 0 have th ski in he game, grow with
ws, nd we eam he busines from hem. So, the question is we ave stated smal, but there is
no reason to not develop and make t big together rather than buying something big and then not
growing i

Pawan Agrawal: And just for the content, Abneesh, our diversified portfolio just few yeas ago, was just bout
19-12% of indi business, and we have taken a target of ching about 25% We have sready
reached about 22% Sit is not about the size ofthe business whe you squire. It i ll bout
he potential that we assess it can become. For example, Sasgata talked about Pix. Similarly,
we are very hopeful tht al these businesses will row bigger over a period of time

Saugats Gupta: And answer your second question, Abneesh, you rs absolutely ight. believe that with True
Elements plus Saffola, we found hat snacking, f realy want 0 grow snackin. it ould become.
restive, and therefore we opened up. Having sid that, we will continue © play in the
premium end, whic i organized rade plus maybe metro food outlets. 1 don’ ink we hve
ight 0 win today ina pan pus or doing a INR 5, INR 10 product right now. We don't ave the
GTM, neither the capbily. But a east opens up as India progresses and the premium set
opens up, believe there is enough ical mass. And you are righ. iis significantly improves
the TAM expansion for our fond business,

Abneesh Roy: My second and ast question ison hair il. So, overall excitement in the hai of is coming back.
in the minds of investors. We have seen th small hai oil company withthe new CEO doing
wel. They have also called out hai il 35 a category. s seeing somewhat of revival. You
have don exceedingly wel past few quarters in VAHO. So. my question i, ss 4 category in
hai oi, ove do ous next one year? Last fw quarters hasbeen goo for VAHO. And second,

adjacent question is, yes, volume growth is sill quite stron for Marico us a company, but when
Parachute starts seeing deflation, and we have sce already 20%-25% deflation in copra from
op. and next crop is also looking decent. As a company; would you see that challenge that
Suddenly he sles growth forthe company in Indi busines comes challenge at some sige?
What will be your take on tha?

Saugata Gupta: See, there are two tings. One i, hi ie the absolute inflaton was very high, which actually
impacted volume growth, and we had done some of the mage reduction, which aniversirizes
in the fist quarter next year. Secondly, you wil be suprised because we were pleasantly
surprised with the pric lastcty ofthe brand. And therfore, when the deflation happens, some
deflation has already happened. we will be fa beter prepared, including a fr, fo thinner
pipeline to manage i. As fur as har oil VAHO growih is concemed, if you ook at the VAHO
roth, the two-year CAGR x of Shani is 14%, the quarterly Y-0-Y growih is vry igh eens
So, we are ata double digt two-year CAGR and it is great tmaround. | believe tha there is
enough opportunity. and what is also helping is SETU, because if Took a he biggest impact
50 far in the states where we have expanded distribution, improved he quality of rural
isribution converted a lo of direct 0 dire, has been he growth of the second and the third
brand, because that i where range selling happens. And SETU, we are today, if you ask me, we
have done ~30%. There s sill 0% to go, nd it s a 3-year projec. | mean, tree years
obviously was nialy designed, but 1 am sure if we can ge i,t going to continue for the
next three to five years. So, we ar extremely confident bout this. And one mre intersting
hing we a doing that at one point inte, the volume val share ap in hie ils was 10%.
Iuhas now zone down 5%. So focus on abandoning the. wor cal it bandoning, but holding
fort i the bottom of pyramid and INR 10-20 pric points, not doing anything ration, but
focusing on the packs like Jasmine, Aloe, Hair & Care, and some of th ahr brands, is actully
helping, and we will continue 0 focus on value share. And as you know, these brands are actually
High margin So, they are helping in the mix. They ar helping i the overall gross margin
improvement over th next couple of year.

Abneesh Roy: “Thats all fom me.

Saugata Gupta: And sony just add, just 0 reassure everyone, tis sa ctegory whic i very coset India
Not only ta, is category ha is significant, even he Middle East including Middle Eastern
countries, Egypt. | mean, this is category that continues to grow, and we have great fit in
his category, and we have ensured that we continue to invest behind this habit. And this abit
i oing o sty. That is someting which we have proven nth lst 20 year, contrary to some
people thinking his category will dic down,

Mibir Shah So. just continuing on VAHO, except for SETU, the kind of gow that we are sing s rally
shar. and apparenly he other players re also scing sharper growth But 1 dont sce them
maying together because each of these subeategoies have a diferent market. They are more
ingredien-hasd har os, which ar prefered. So, wha s ely driving this growth? Whats
‘sustainable number for VAHO that we can hk bout over the nea erm, maybe he next two
to four quarters? So, that is part A. Part B i, given VAHO hs the highest margin in the core:
busines, higher than Parachute and Saffoa, and ss copra headwinds start (0 wane and those
‘margins will tat improving, higher growth fom VAHO can add t that margin expansion. So,
how should oe think bot hat lay as well? So tht is my frst question

Saugata Gupta: Coming to, we ar extremely confident of delivering double-ligit value growth in VAHO. And
a5 you se, recent trends about also a doubleigit volume growth i alo very much possible.
Aad sce it is combination of differen factors the resource allocation is working. We have
converted aot of monies which was locked into BTL, spends in he 10-20 packs of Shanti Ami
into ATL. We believe, the job of a market leader is to drive equity and not be ssid i he
competitor docs spend witha SOV, because ulimately we have significantly invested in SOV
IF you Tok at the reach and the weighted distribution of cach of the brands due 0 SETU hs
increase sufficiently, and far more sharper positioning and a portfolio spprsch across states
‘You are absolutely right bout the mix, because the moment he mix of VAHO increases, that
willbe a margin kind ofa tailwind. And 1 wil want Pawan t answer the expectation on the
margin.

Pawan Agrawal: Mii, th fist thing hat yo ssid i, ofcourse, value-added hai of hs beter margins, and that
exactly is the reason as why we cold il deliver reasonably resilient profit growth this year,
despite significant copra inflation, because the mix has helped. Now, us far as next year is
concerned, again giving a sidance with respec 1 wha kind of a percentage margin we can
delivers difficult, but a least we are very confident of efvering at last mid-tee growth. We
could ry for more, and at least we would tiv for improving the operating margin by about
150-200 basis pons.

Minir Shah “That is very clear, Thanks for that. Second, on the copra-ed price cus, given tha this time
around price increases wre relatively very shar. here sa expectation hath pric cuts ls
probably willbe very sharp. So, wanted 0 get sense on how should one hink about the pricing
in Parachute as you go down the quire, given copra is aleady down 30%. Masbe in a month
or two, you had eae highlighted tha pice cuts ca probably star in Feb or March. 1 wanted
to get sens ofthat, and how many times do you think that one will have to tke price cuts to
ensure the trade channel remain helthy in terms of stocking? So, that s the second question.

Pawan Agrawal: So. Mili we havent aken any pricing action so ar and there are two, the essons for tha
Fil. we hd not taken pric increase in line with te increase in copra prices. Copra prices

had sh up by more than 100%, but we hod taken pri increase of 60%. So. now hat he copra
prices have cometed by 25%-30%, we are pot aking any immedi conection rom a premium
standpoint as in premium fo foas ol, we are sill comforiable and therefor, we need not be
geting into pricing action immedi. Secondly, we are stl awaiting to get a im handle on
how the copra price tsjctory ill move, which we will get by March-April, and then take
correction in one go, the than aking in multiple steps, because if you tke pricing conection
in mulipleseps, it disturbs the trade shythm. So, thats How we are looking at it. However, we
may pass on some benefit through some sat of consumer offers, <tc. in leu of pricing n the
interim bere we gt frm handle with respeet how copra will behave, and then we ake
firmer price cuts.

Saugata Gupta: See, we wan o be clear about the visibility of what shouldbe the price cut and ake oe price
ut We will not take muliple price cus. The big change that has happened is that we work with
fa, or thinner pipelines because of ou suply hain efficiencies and ur Al-bsed forecasting
models. So. therfore, we are compared fo, say, ive years ago and all hat, hat he changeover,
‘which used 0 take § weeks 10 12 weeks, especially in url his s going 10 be much fster
because of what we are doing now.

Minir Shah: “Thais very clea.

Moderator: Our next question comes from th fine of Hart Kapoor from Invesce. Please go ahead

Harit Kapoor: “There i two questions. First ison foods. The grow rte, you had already mentioned n the
ast quae hat you wil look at the profiaily, just adjust it and then see an acceleration in
row. You hav spoken shout 25% CAGR as well in your presentation. Just wanted to know,
whats the timeline that we ca expect that you se a ecovery in the growth te sarting o kind
fick up again on he fod side? And the second question on Bangladesh. Again, phenomenal
performance in that market. a you have continued 0 do extremely wel, but hee continue to
be some macrocconomic uncertainties. So, just wanted your thought, the ast ime something
ike this happened. you Kind of went through relatively unscathed. Jus wanted to get our sense
on how do you see the positon an ground? S, hes ae he wo questions.

Saugata Gupta: As far as food is concemned, a far as the organic part of he food s concerned, we will gt back
to grow inthe coming two quarters, When we talk about food, 20%-25% grow, its a
combination of organic, inorganic and we are absolutely certain we wil star geting bck ino
25% growth of foo business. Now, coming o Bangladesh, yes, we are waiting, we ae closely
monitoring the situation. So fr, we have been extremely resilient, Even in Quarter 2, when the
ses were quite grim in tems of the, it was in August that this hing happened. That quarter,
we grew by 8%. So. we have taken steps out he, and we don't sc any reason t be extremely
concerned a this moment in time in terms of delivering busines.

Harit Kapoor: And 1 could ake one more question. The Parachute process tha you have mentioned is
basicaly saying that there was a reduction n he RPI hat you were making because you took
a much Tower price increase than you did, and you wait for those RPIs fo maybe slightly
normalize tle bit, and then you take the one shot pric ag. Thats ight”

Saugata Gupta: es that i right, That is ight. Se, if you loo ati, copra scully moved more than 100%, We
ook 60% price hike. At current levels, ou pice premium is sill leable, and therefore, we
will wai, by a cena time, where we gt visibility of what will be th likely input cost for
he large part of the year. When it happens, we will tke one shot, one price, we will ake. And
as sid, that the wo differences are that we obviously have a far more thinner pipeline and a
fr beter positon in terms of ur ability to handle this. Yes, in the past we have struggled, but
his me we are confident tha hee wil be mo such sss as fa as volume growh is concerned
Ao in any case the absolut pricing was so igh his ime, hat hod impacted volume grow

Harit Kapoor: Great to hear,

Moderator: Our net question comes rom the fing of Perey rom I1FL Pleas go ahead

Perey: Hi, Saugata. My question i also on the coprs pricing only. So, supposing f thi pric remains
where itis, which is Hike a 20% down, and you are saying hat you re comfortable with his ind
of a premium tothe oer players, in that kind ofa station, what kind of margin expansion can
‘we expect on a overall consol basis for the company because ofthe ring benefit on the copra?

Pawan Agrawal: So. we dnt say that we will not ake any pricing ston. We Just want to gta firm handle of
what the copra tsjctory coud be. I it wer to remain 20% lower, then sil we might ake
correction, bat over a period of time, which we may not be doing immediatly. And therefore,
from a margin standpoint, just mentioned, | mean, very difficult 0 give you margin percentage
suidunce, very confident of dering mid-tcens growth. But we il definitely sive for, as |
sid cari, that 150 10 200 basis pois margin expansion we should ty and improve.

bere: Okay, midcens growth in rupee tems on EBITDA

Pavan Agrawal: Opening prof, ys.

Saugata Gupta: es that should be our base case.

Perey: Secondly. just wanted to understand on Saffola foods, this quart growth i nly 5%. What is
he reason for tht?

Sagara Gupta: AS Told you that, two things: One, we re cnsuring profabilty. so we ake, lo of businesses
which we believe i, two things. One, we had these things like mayo, peanut buter and all that

we have rationalized, which was there perhaps in he bas. Some of the SKUs which, we have
reduced complexity, rationalized same of the SKUs. And tidy, in cern SKUs ino
customerchamnel, which are ot so profiabl, we have rationalized that also. Because | believe
in fod. you have to continuously, afer every two, he years, get info one icp jump ito
profabily.

Perey: So, would be right assuming that if you have sort of rationalized he SKU ef tis burden
will be ther or another hrc quarters before it anniveraizes and your growth would probably
in single digit?

Saugata Gupta: No, one to two quarcrs. We stared this 1.5 quarters ago, so within ove the est 2 quarer, we
will tan seing growih, god growth. In any case, a 1 said, that our ambition on foods of 0%
25% includes organic plus inorganic. So. ou will start scing 20% growth in any case there
from nent quarter

Perey: es, bu that is because of 4700BC, right”

Sagara Gupta: es that fine, because we have always sid that over long fem, our growth ambition is a
mixture of organic and inorganic. So, it fine.

Perey: “Thats all from me.

Moderator: Our et question cames from the fing o Nihal Mahesh Tham rom HSBC. Pease 2 ahead

Nal Mahesh Jha: Saugata, congratulations onthe ood performance Just, continuing on he foods bit fi, a you
highlighted, sit mainly case of mderation i the prtfolo on the SKU bass? Or are we also,
say, optimizing some of the advertising spends in, 3. a lo of these olin frst brands? And
whereas the confidence coming, i eave apart th inorganic clement, hat you mentioned bout
47008 sor of being consolidated, ht the growth i going to recover in two quarers. So, what
is driving that confidence?

Saugata Gupta: “Two things. One, as said 0 we have stopped, rationalized, some of the products, lke we had
some flavors, some things lik, what 1 call mayo. peanut bute and some of the staff we had
launched. So. that amiversarizaton is goin t happen. Secondly, obviously, al the investments
will go focused back nto diving penetration of our core. So, we have now rationalized and hat
should driv some ofthe growth back. Now, a said. as long as, we expec the growh £0, 10
0 back no double digits. And, obviously: his does include any innovation. Any innovation
‘which we do organically from out base portfolio also adds o tha, So, our first sep is over the
next wo quarters fo get nto double digits, which we are prety confident about, And the, te

“There are only two things at play. We are obviously sing on our aw materi inventory, so
hat somewhere init immediate pricing action. And then there i channel pipeline ls, which

On the channel pipeline, you mentioned yo are running much thinner, buts thre case where
we may Have to maybe agarssvely reduce our rics, and that can maybe have an impact in

there be alo of dynamic clement this quarter which could end up impacting the performance
of the PCNO category?

Sangata Gupta: No. 1 don’ think so. Now, we ae talking about ne mon s down the quarter in this quarer
Anda 1 sid, to things. One i that we are comfortable with our price premium as we are

1 man, an inflationary cycle, weaker brands, they rely become weak. Number thre, which i
aso give us hope hat a east one of our competitors is being extremely rational on pricing.
because we also faced, as you know, imtionl pricing from two competitors in the past, and
ow at cas one of the is following atonal pricing model, which believe is good, because
atthe end of the day, thre iso pont seling a giv gross margin. That spoil the market

delivering double-digit organic growth, This is an aberration, and we have (0 get i sorted within
the next 1 or 2 quarters, we are confident of.

Moderator: Ou next question comes from the fine of Prakash Kapadia from Kapadia Financial Services.
Please go ahead.

Prakash Kapadia: Just wanted fo get a sense on th cold-pressed market. Any thoughts? Are we late in the segment
because it is already a competitive market, or the TAM is very large, and we see structural
opportunites with increasing health awareness? So, wht is your thought on that? And typically,
itis more forthe Q-<om, e-com customer only the general trade would be lower, is what I would
ues.

‘And secondly, Saugata, on the GST cuts, how do we see volume growth picking up? Is there
tailwind for larger players like us where growth can be higher and we can gain market share?

Saugata Gupta: Coming to cold-pressed oils, it sarid off as a niche kind, but it is rapidly catching up. In fct,
its a big trend today in the Western markets. And as you know. India picks up a fot of trends
from UK. and the U.S, the developed markets, in tems of food habits at the premium end. Yes,
itis currently a far more skew in ¢-com, but we believe we are iow secing this in modem trade,
and it will very soon be a critical mass. We are not at fo the party at al. | would call ourselves
fast follower with a brand which has significant equity, and we have now a broad participation
sirategy. The good thing is it makes significant higher margins than some of the entry-level
Safola, which will also help in the profiabilt of Saffol, and we will also invest. And
Sometimes what happens in a category with low penetration, if you have two, three serious
players investing behind the catsgory the category grows. And this i exactly the position where
cold-pressed ofl is. And it i today a drop i the ocean inthe large edible oil space. But as you
Know, you had all the premium hair oils, premium edible ols, which grew. For example, how
we grew Saffola, how the premium pat grew or sone ofthe other spaces grew. cold pressed oil
also will have a critical mass very soon. modern trade and premium GT will see a significant
presence of cold-pressed ili the couple of years.

Prakash Kapadia: And typically, consumers are ready to pay 2x pric of edible of. Is tht the broader price you
want ta?

Saugata Gupta: See, Twill tell you how it works. Today, a the premium end, while people are wanting to pay
for heaihy oil they ae also using les oil. Als, if you look at people eating out, people ordering.
in through food apps, people traveling abroad, actual ooking oil consumprion at the premium
end, in terms of tal volume actually has gone down a bit So, 1 don’ hink the outlay is that
significant novgh for the top end. So, that dela for health i absolutly acceptable because they

are doing i for lots of things. For example, on fod today: people re willing (0 spend om health
slong as whether itis tition, doctors, some of he influencers who ae actually advocating
for such things and some things which hase also grown i he Wesiem marke, something which
has a health itwind.

Prakash Kapadia: And on he midierm grow with some of hese cut, is here a play for higher grow? Because
Some of these male players could get marginalized. How do we se that shaping up?

Saugata Gupta: 1 didnt get your question This is for which category yon ar talking about?

Prakash Kapadia: No, general, volume growih inthe midterm, given that GST cut hs happened, which was not
expected last quarter. From here on, i there room for higher growth and sale players could
lose market share structurally? 1s that an opportunity?

Saugata Gupta: Absoluely. See, 1 will ll you what has happened is that a est in food and packaged food,
‘where packaged food penetration in Indi is low, he fact thatthe entire packaged food sa 5%,
that definitly encourages conversion from wnbranded to branded, unpackaged to packaged
Packaged fod i hyicnic packaged ood is aspirational.

Similarly. in some of the Personal Car categories, mass categoris, which hav become $6,
here Will be a medium to long-term movement towards aspirational brands, because of he
affordability actor, which has now se in wih tis significant reduction in GST, especially
Personal Care categories, which have moved from 18% to 5%, which means significant
reduction and driving affordability because as the counry's GDP improves, as the per capita
income improves, people want aspirational brands.

Its the outlay which sometimes is a restriction. And therefor, strcturally, nthe medium erm,
GST is transformative, 1 will definitly give added growih to all th brands, especialy in
categories which have seen significant GST cut

Moderator: Ladies and enlemen, we wil no take our as question from the line of Sheela Rathi from
Morgan Sanley. Please 0 ahead.

Sheela Rati: My question swith respect othe 4TO0BC acpisition. The ist part of he question i, now tht,
‘Suga, you talked about how diferent the disbuton for tis brand has been, where they are
catering to institutions, ines, and mals, i there need for us 0 eam or unlearn with respect
to the disibution stacey. or we will just focus on what we are strong a, whichis the retail
isibution” And the scond par 1 his question is, wha is he real competion in tis category
a his point me? 1 am sue he TAM is il small but who re the res competitors here?

Saugata Gupta: Let me frst address the second question. sec, you have to sce TAM as snacking. A consumer
can fake samosas, consumer can have a popcorn, soup, noodles, and they can have rag chips.
So. the enire thing that you have to look at, you are playing in a slightly mre indulgent but
better-for-you gourmet portion of snacking, and the market is enormaus. So, i docs have
popcam to popcom, unless you are going only fora movie. And as sid tht part of the business
i extremely low. There is no need to unlear. This bran has significant legs, and 1 ssid tht for
sampling people to experience the product, what they are doing in institutional selling will
continue. The brand is sill 60%-70% retail. I is currently mostly e-com. So, therefore, th first
thing is obviously to grow that in things like modem trade, premium food outlets using the
Marico GTM. And in fact, this will help us tomorrow, for example, looking at True Elements
for institutional sales. If person can have popcorn an fight, why can't they have some mixed
nuts on a flight from True Elements? So, therefore, actualy it opens up mliple synergies. It
‘opens up multiple vectors of growth. At the same time, as I sad, with True Elements, is brand
and others, there are a ot of syneries at the back end and cost. Today, cach brand has their own
sales system and cost structure, when ii standalone versus Marico. So, thre will be significant
opportunites, which then can be plowed back towards investment behind the brand o grow it
further

Moderator: Thank you. 1 would now like to hand the conference over fo the management for closing

volume growth and log market shares and penetration gains in India business, despie
inflationary headwinds in some of the key core categories. The inematianal business continues
0 grow from ssength-to-stzcngth, supported by & broad-based performance across markets. We

strengihening our operating profit growth trajectory in the quarters ahead
